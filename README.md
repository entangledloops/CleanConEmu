**A clean, Linux-like ConEmu configuration**

## Why use this? ##

Standard Command Prompt isn't for you, and you want some nice simple Linux behavior on your Windows machine.
For example, suppose you'd like a simple bash-like tabbed console emulator interface, that prints a standard `ls`
command like this:

![ls](http://www.entangledloops.com/img/ConEmu/ls.png)

And context menu integration in a slick little overhead, like this:

Out-of-the-box [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io) is a great piece of software.
So is [GoW](https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow/wiki).
Although ConEmu comes prepackaged with [Clink](https://mridgers.github.io/clink), I'd suggest you grab the latest of that yourself too.

I've made some enhancements to the vanilla ConEmu settings that I think a wide audience might enjoy, if you're using a setup that involves these three components.

## Install ##

1) Download [ConEmu.xml](http://www.entangledloops.com/config/ConEmu.xml) by right-clicking and "Save as..."

2) In ConEmu settings (or upon install), choose "Import..." and select the file.

That's it!
